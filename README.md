## Introduction

 [Browserstack](https://www.bstackdemo.com/) is an e-commerce website. I performed automated testing on the Browserstack e-commerce website using Selenium and Java, covering various modules of the application. Here's a summary of the test modules I worked on:

 #### Login Module:
 - Developed automated test scripts to verify the login functionality.
 #### Vendors Module:
 - Created automated tests to validate vendor-related features like select Apple, oneplus option.
 #### OrderBy
 - Implemented automated test cases for sorting products on the website.
 - Tested ascending and descending sorting options.
 - Verified that sorting is consistent and accurate.
 #### Add to Cart Module:
 - Automated the process of adding products to the shopping cart.
 - Ensured that selected items are correctly added to the cart.
 - Checked the cart's content and quantity.
 #### Checkout Module:

 #### Orders History Module:
